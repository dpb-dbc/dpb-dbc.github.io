### "Persisting" (Storing and Retrieving) Data
--


You will encounter several different methods:
--


 1. text files
--


    * plain text, CSV, other separators
--

 1. databases
--

    * SQL, ActiveRecord
--

 1. JSON
--
: a format (native to JavaScript) of great importance on the web
---

### "Schema"
--
: Data Model
--

 1. To-do list — what did the data consist of (in the early versions of the challenge)?
--

    * task
--

    * ID number
--

 1. One-to-one: each ID number had one task associated with it, and each task had one ID number associated with it. We also had a "completed" element (and that can stay in the same one-to-one table).
 1. Use Unified Modeling Language (**UML**, mid-1990s) diagrams to model this. See the [UML Tool of Ondřej Žára](https://schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com/) (cloned from https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner; original demo [here](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/))

    * "Table", which is the blueprint for different "records" or "**rows**".
    * Each row has various "fields" or "**columns**". There is always an ID number and at least one other column.
    * A table's ID number is normally used as its "**primary key**" — by which individual records are accessed.

---

### How are tables related to one another?

 1. **One-to-many**

    Ask: of categories X and Y, how many of X can Y have, and how many of Y can X have?

    * Example: real estate brokers and customers. One broker may have many customers, but (under the rules of our imaginary company) no customer is allowed to work with more than one broker at once.
    * Model with UML.
    * **Foreign key** accesses the ID (primary key) of another table.

 1. **Many-to-many**

    * Example: people and phone numbers. 
    * Model with UML.
    * We are not allowed simply to connect two tables directly as many-to-many. We need a third table — a **join table** or junction table — to model the many-to-many relationship. **The relationship itself gets a special table.**

 1. **One-to-one**

    * In a one-to-one relationship, normally everything can go into one table.
    * In a one-to-one relationship, it's conventional to use a plural name — people, customers, etc.

 1. More examples — try and categorize them

    * word : reversal_of_word
    * bookstore : book
    * heads : tails
    * person : phone_number
    * dog-walkers : dogs
    * person : social_security_number
    * author : book
    * bank customer : bank product
    * person : parent_of_person
    * person : last_name
    * hotel : guest
