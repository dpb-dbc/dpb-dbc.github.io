# Recursion
## David Branner
### 20160120

---

### Outline

1. What recursion is
1. Example: Counting down from some starting number
1. Example: The Fibonacci Series (the most famous case)
1. Example: Comparing all elements of a series to find the maximum

---

### What recursion is
--

Recursion means having a program call itself.
--


The reason to do this is if the task can be broken conveniently into two parts:
--

1. One relatively simple action, usually leaving some remainder as yet undone.
--

1. Handling of the undone remainder, by the same program.
--


The top-listed part is called the "base case". The bottom-listed part is called the "recursive case". 
--


I'm avoiding saying "part one" and "part two" because they're not usually carried out in that order 
--

— the recursive case is carried out first, usually over and over again, and when the base case is reached, recursion stops. That's why it's called the base case. 
--


(Aside: if you ever study mathematical proofs, you'll find that a recursive program has the same structure as an "inductive" proof — proving that `f(k)` is true for some value of `k` is the base case, and proving that `f(k+1)` is also true, is the recursive case.)

---

### What recursion is, cont'd
--


There are two insights involved:
--

1. The recursive case shows you the insight that the problem can be solved recursively.
--

1. The base case shows you the insight as to what stops the recursion.
--


You need both insights.
--


**But to read and understand, I suggest starting with the recursive case.**
--


Some examples, now…
---

### Example: Counting down from some starting number
--


```ruby
def countdown(items)
  if items == 0           # Base case
    puts "Here is the base case; we're done."
  else
    puts "Counting down from #{items}, and then calling recursively..."
    countdown(items-1)    # Call recursively
    puts "... now unwinding from recursive call at items = #{items}."
  end
end
```
--

One other thing: Notice that the "now unwinding" line only starts running **after** we have hit the base case. 
--

Even though it appears in the code right after the recursive call to `countdown`, that `countdown` doesn't return until the base case has been hit.
--


Here's the output (next page):

---

### Example: Counting down from some starting number
--


```ruby
[1] pry(main)> def countdown(items)
[1] pry(main)*   if items == 0           # Base case  
[1] pry(main)*     puts "Here is the base case; we're done."    
[1] pry(main)*   else    
[1] pry(main)*     puts "Counting down from #{items}, and then calling recursively..."    

[1] pry(main)*     countdown(items-1)    # Call recursively    
[1] pry(main)*     puts "... now unwinding from recursive call at items = #{items}."    

[1] pry(main)*   end    
[1] pry(main)* end  
=> :countdown
[2] pry(main)> countdown(5)
Counting down from 5, and then calling recursively...
Counting down from 4, and then calling recursively...
Counting down from 3, and then calling recursively...
Counting down from 2, and then calling recursively...
Counting down from 1, and then calling recursively...
Here is the base case; we're done.
... now unwinding from recursive call at items = 1.
... now unwinding from recursive call at items = 2.
... now unwinding from recursive call at items = 3.
... now unwinding from recursive call at items = 4.
... now unwinding from recursive call at items = 5.
=> nil
```
--

### Example: The Fibonacci Series 
---

### Example: The Fibonacci Series (the most famous case)
--


The Fibonacci Series is a [sequence of integers](https://oeis.org/A000045):
--

```
   0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 
   4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 
   514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887, 9227465, 14930352, 
   24157817, 39088169, ... (from On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences)
```
--

Each one is the sum of the previous two. 
--

That means if we want the `n`th one, all we have to do is add together the `(n-1)`st and the `(n-2)`nd. 
--

How do we find the `(n-1)`st? By adding together the `(n-2)`nd and the `(n-3)`rd. And so on.
--



```ruby
# Return the nth Fibonacci number (zero-indexed)
def fibonacci(n)
  if n <= 1                                   # Base case
    puts "At base case: returning #{n}."
    n
  else
    puts "Now call fibonacci(#{n-1} [#{n}-1]) and fibonacci(#{n-2} [#{n}-2])"
    answer = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)  # Call recursively
    puts "... now unwinding from fibonacci(#{n-1}) and fibonacci(#{n-2})"
    answer
  end
end```
--

Because of the amount of duplicate work involved, this is not an effective use of recursion. 
--

But it illustrates the problem well.

---

### Example: Comparing all elements of a series to find the maximum
--

```ruby
# Find maximum item in "things" by comparing them, two at a time,
# and returning the larger one.
def find_max(things)    
  if things.length <= 2      # Base case: end recursion if this is true.
    a = things[0]
    b = things[-1]
  else                       # Otherwise, call recursively.
    a = find_max(things.slice!(0,things.length/2))
    b = find_max(things)
  end    

  if a < b                   # This is the only actual comparison
    b
  else
    a
  end
end
```
